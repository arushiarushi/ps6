The data set I am working with is called the “Covid-19 Healthy Diet Dataset”, built 2 years ago and accessed through Kaggle. The columns I am specifically using in this data set are Recovered, Country, and Vegetables because I am trying to show the correlation between a vegetarian diet and Recovery rate amongst individuals who got and recovered from Covid-19. My plot shows the correlation between between total vegetable intake and covid-19 recovery rates. The first widget allows the user to use a slider to view a certain number of points. The color scheme selection allows for the user to view the data points as red or orange. On the table display page, I have a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a country and my table shows the vegetable intake and recovery rate for that specific country. On the home page, I show the number of rows that the total data set has and I showed sepcific columns that are relevant to my application. 
I worked for 5 hours on this assignment in Professor Ott's office hour room.
